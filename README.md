# web1-binary

everyone says to build a calculator to learn javascript, so i decided to make one that can also do binary conversions. along the way, i figured i may as well add the other bases as well.

currently works for all bases 2-10. more to come.

you can set the input base, operand base, and the base you want the final answer in.
